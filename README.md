# bank-test

This my solution to the bank test from the Makers Bootcamp. The requirements were: 

1. You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or Node. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
2. Deposits, withdrawal.
3. Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
4. Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).


## How to run the code

    nvm use node
    npm init -y
    npm add jest
    npm install -g jest
    node bank.js

## How to run the tests

    jest
